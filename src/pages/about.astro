      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        The Caring Place was established in 1982 by a coalition of churches
        serving Golf Manor, Kennedy Heights, Pleasant Ridge, and Silverton. Our
        goal is to provide a variety of services to members of our communities
        who find themselves in need of food, clothing, furniture, rent and
        utility assistance, family development and support groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volunteers primarily come from participating churches and local schools
        including Nativity School, Seven Hills Academy, and Schroder Paideia
        High School.
