About Us
========

The Caring Place was established in 1982 by a coalition of churches serving Golf Manor, Kennedy Heights, Pleasant Ridge, and Silverton. Our goal is to provide a variety of services to members of our communities who find themselves in need of food, clothing, furniture, rent and utility assistance, family development and support groups.

Volunteers primarily come from participating churches and local schools including Nativity School, Seven Hills Academy, and Schroder Paideia High School.
